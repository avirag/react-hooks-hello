# React hooks
* Hooks are functions.
* React provides a few built-in Hooks like useState. You can also create your own Hooks.
* Hooks don't work inside classes.
* useEffect - React runs the effects after every render.
* Only call Hooks at the top level. Don't call Hooks inside loops, conditions or nested functions.
* Only call Hooks from React function components.
